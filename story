para 1:
Once upon a time, there lived a little girl called Little Red Riding Hood. She wore a beautiful red cape
that her grandma had made for her.
One day, her mother said, “Come here Little Red Riding Hood. Your grandma is not very well. I would
like you to take this bread and cheese to her but remember to stay on the path.”

para 2:
The wolf asked. “Where are you going to?” Little Red Riding Hood said, “I am going to see my
grandma because she is not very well.”
The wolf gazed at her and said, “See these pretty flowers? Why not pick some, I am sure your
grandma would love them.” “What a good idea,” said Little Red Riding Hood, and she skipped from
the path to look for flowers for her grandma.
