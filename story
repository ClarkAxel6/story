Once upon a time, there lived a little girl called Little Red Riding Hood. She wore a beautiful red cape
that her grandma had made for her.
One day, her mother said, “Come here Little Red Riding Hood. Your grandma is not very well. I would
like you to take this bread and cheese to her but remember to stay on the path.”
